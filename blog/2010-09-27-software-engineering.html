There&#x27;s this cool new open-source bridge-building framework that makes the whole thing out of bamboo and twine in less than a minute. It&#x27;s so cool.

The western half of the support structure was done last month, and the bamboo is holding up nicely. It hasn&#x27;t fallen down again in weeks now.<br/><br/>Bill: My part is pretty much done...<br/><br/>Al: Pretty much done? You said it would take two weeks, remember that?<br/><br/>Bill: Yeah, but I had to change the plans and use metal instead of wood, and it took me a while to perfect my alloy...<br/><br/>Al: Your alloy?!?<br/><br/>Bill: Yes, it&#x27;s custom made just for this bridge. But it&#x27;s taking a while to retool my steel mill.<br/><br/>Al: You built your own steel mill? What the hell?<br/><br/>Bill: Of course. It also takes time to ship the ore from my mine...<br/><br/>Al: (shaking head) And what&#x27;s up with the road surface? It looks like it&#x27;s made of two-by fours.<br/><br/>Doug: Yes, but that&#x27;s just the default road surface that you get out-of-the-box. You can configure that arbitrarily at drive-time by injecting an appropriate implementation of the road-to-frame interface into the bridge configuration...<br/><br/>Al: And the railings? Why aren&#x27;t they done?<br/><br/>Carl: There was insufficient evidence from the user-stories I collected over the last 5 months to support the effort required, so we de-scoped them.<br/><br/>Al: (sigh) Is there anything else I should know?<br/><br/>Eric: Well, I&#x27;m not too happy with the test coverage...<br/><br/>Al: I have an idea for testing. You four get in a dumptruck and drive across.
