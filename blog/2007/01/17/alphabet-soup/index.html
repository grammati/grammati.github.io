While playing with them (yes, I play with them more than she does), it occurred to me to wonder "What's the longest word I can make, given that I only have one of each letter?".  And of course, it occurred to me a second later that I could write a program that would find out the answer.  Being the geek that I am, I immediately grabbed my laptop and whipped up some code.<br /><br />I remembered that I had a file kicking around that I got from <a href="http://www.itasoftware.com/careers/puzzles/WORD.LST">here</a>.  It's just a big-ass text file with a whole lot of words in it (173528 of them - didn't know there were that many words in English, did you?).   A few seconds later I had my answer.   Don't worry, I won't give it away, because I know you are dying to code it up yourself, and I don't want to ruin your fun.   Go ahead and do it now - I'll wait.<br /><br />.<br />.<br />.<br />Done?  Good.  Wasn't that fun?  I hope you got the same answer I did.  Hint:  if you wrote more than one line of code, you're probably using the wrong language ;)<br /><br />Okay, now on to the really fun stuff.  The next thing that occurred to me was "Can I make a set of words that use up all 26 letters?".  So once again, off to the laptop to find the answer.  Well, as it turns out, that one seems to require a little more than one line of code.  And more importantly, it seems to require an awfully long time to run.  I got as far as letting it run overnight once, and the best I got so far was 25 letters.<br /><br />So I don't have a solution for this, but I'll come back to it someday.</p></div></article></div></div><footer role="contentinfo"><p>Copyright Â© 2020 - Chris Perkins</p></footer></body></html>
