It's amazing that a single tool has the power to make all my development grind to a halt.  If you are the author of a Python library, I'm begging you not to rely on setuptools - at least not until it gets fixed.  Here's what's wrong with it:<br /><br />1) Every time I use it, it complains that it needs to be updated.  Come on - are you seriously telling me that copying a few files around absolutely requires v.0.6c5, and that v.0.6c3 is just not up to the task?  Give me a break.<br />2) It can't update itself.  easy_install setuptools fails.<br />3) Following 2), I of course need to go and find a downloadable version of setuptools.  But there doesn't seem to be any such thing.  There is just ez_setup, which does what setuptools itself does, which is to go to cheeseshop.python.org to get the files it needs.  Which leads me to the next point:<br />4) cheeseshop.python.org is down!  And when it's down, the Python universe grinds to a halt.  So when I need to install something, I have to do it the old fashioned way - I go and download a zip file, unpack it, and run setup.py install... which takes us back to point 1).   AAAAAAARRRRHHHH!!!!!!!<br /><br />I think I'll just go and drink beer for the rest of the afternoon instead of writing code.  Setuptools, you win.  You sapped my will to live.  Congratulations.</p></div></article></div></div><footer role="contentinfo"><p>Copyright Â© 2020 - Chris Perkins</p></footer></body></html>
