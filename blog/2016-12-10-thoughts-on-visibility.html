myself), and it was not all that pleasant.</p>
<p>I want better tools. I have for years. The tools have gotten vastly better over
the years I have been doing Clojure, but we can still do much better.</p>
<p>Having just seen several great talks about tools at Clojure Conj, I&#x27;m convinced
that we can do better right now. In particular:</p>
<ul>
<li>Proto-REPL - Jason showed off exactly the kind of data-structure
visualizations that I have been dreaming of for years. I sure do love me some
emacs, but I could be convinced to change if this thing is good enough.</li>
<li>Sayid - Bill gave a glimpse into the future with a tool that captures a
complete record of a program&#x27;s execution, fully inspectable. This, too, I have
been dreaming of for years. (I even started to write almost exactly the same
thing myself, <a href="https://github.com/grammati/rosco">here</a>, but didn&#x27;t get nearly
as far with it as Bill has).</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, there were a <em>lot</em> of talks about clojure.spec, and I&#x27;m embarrassed
to admit that I haven&#x27;t really tried it yet, but I have high hopes.</p>
<p>Finally, spectrum looks extremely promising - it&#x27;s more-or-less a static type
checker for Clojure.</p>
<p>In addition to all that, I&#x27;m becoming convinced that I need to make more effort
to build visibility into my programs. I do plenty of logging, but poring through
logs sucks. I&#x27;m not entirely sure how to go about this, but in general I&#x27;m
thinking about putting in more &quot;dev-mode only&quot; code that captures data in
various places (eg: messages received on a kafka queue) and exposes them
through special, dev-mode only HTTP endpoints. I&#x27;ll need to explore this to get
a more concrete idea of what would be useful.</p></div></div><footer class="footer"><p>Â© Chris Perkins 2023</p></footer></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"post":{"title":"Thoughts on Visibility (in Clojure)","slug":"blog/2016-12-10-thoughts-on-visibility","published":true,"datePublished":"2016-12-10T00:00:00.000Z","mdx":{"compiledSource":"/*@jsxRuntime automatic @jsxImportSource react*/\nconst {Fragment: _Fragment, jsx: _jsx, jsxs: _jsxs} = arguments[0];\nconst {useMDXComponents: _provideComponents} = arguments[0];\nfunction _createMdxContent(props) {\n  const _components = Object.assign({\n    p: \"p\",\n    ul: \"ul\",\n    li: \"li\",\n    a: \"a\",\n    em: \"em\"\n  }, _provideComponents(), props.components);\n  return _jsxs(_Fragment, {\n    children: [_jsx(_components.p, {\n      children: \"I just spent a couple of days debugging some Clojure code (most of which I wrote\\nmyself), and it was not all that pleasant.\"\n    }), \"\\n\", _jsx(_components.p, {\n      children: \"I want better tools.
