There are only two steps.<br /><br />1) Does it work fine in FireFox, but fail to do anything at all in I.E.? If yes: you have an extra trailing comma somewhere. Find it and get rid of it. Otherwise go to step 2. <br /><br />2) "this" doesn't mean what you think it does. Look carefully at all uses of "this" in the code you just wrote. There is somewhere that it really means "window".<br /><br />That's all. Pretty simple, isn't it?<br /><br />OK, seriously, there are a few more things that can be wrong in JavaScript code - but in practice, this procedure will correctly diagnose 95% of all coding errors.<br /><br />More practically, I would like to suggest a way that text editors could greatly reduce the incidence of the "this" error. All they have to do is highlight a little better. Here's a before and after:<br /><br /></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_gUHj_1QPwWM/TMCnfcwHSUI/AAAAAAAAAOk/n2NwAGMQnIk/s1600/rainbowthis.PNG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_gUHj_1QPwWM/TMCnfcwHSUI/AAAAAAAAAOk/n2NwAGMQnIk/s1600/rainbowthis.PNG" /></a></div><br />Get it? The green "this" ain't necessarily the same thing as the red "this". Having them look different would, I hope, get programmers to pay a little more attention to what "this" really means in each new scope.<br /><br />I wonder if any editors already do this?</div></article></div></div><footer role="contentinfo"><a href="/atom.xml">Feed</a><p>Copyright Â© 2020 - Chris Perkins</p></footer></body></html>
