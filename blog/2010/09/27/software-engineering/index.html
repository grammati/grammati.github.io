The roads are ready on each side, we just need the bridge now. It has to have two lanes, and support vehicles up to 12 tons. Let's make a plan.<br /><br />Bill: That's easy - just give me a hammer and a box of nails. I'll be done in two weeks if everyone stays out of my way.<br /><br />Carl: No, no, we need to start by engaging the customer and starting to flesh out the user stories.<br /><br />Bill: Here's a story for you: "Old lady drives into river because dumbass engineer took too long to build a bridge".<br /><br />Doug: No, we should start by defining a set of well-defined interfaces between the components of the bridge - the frame-to-road-surface interface, the road-to-car interface...  Then we should look at building some factories for each of those components - abstract factories, actually.  Then when someone wants to drive across, they just have to sign the contract stating that they will conform to the vehicle-side interface contract...<br /><br />Eric: Forget all that enterprise bridge-building crap - that's so last year. There's this cool new open-source bridge-building framework that makes the whole thing out of bamboo and twine in less than a minute. It's so cool. Apparently its strength is unproven on bridges over 12 inches in length, but I'm sure it will work out...<br /><br />Al: Ok, ok, it sounds like we've got some ideas flowing. I'll let you guys get to it.<br /><br />6 Months Later<br /><br />Al: What the hell is going on with this bridge? We were supposed to be done in two months.<br /><br />Eric: My part is done! The western half of the support structure was done last month, and the bamboo is holding up nicely. It hasn't fallen down again in weeks now.<br /><br />Bill: My part is pretty much done...<br /><br />Al: Pretty much done? You said it would take two weeks, remember that?<br /><br />Bill: Yeah, but I had to change the plans and use metal instead of wood, and it took me a while to perfect my alloy...<br /><br />Al: Your alloy?!?<br /><br />Bill: Yes, it's custom made just for this bridge. But it's taking a while to retool my steel mill.<br /><br />Al: You built your own steel mill? What the hell?<br /><br />Bill: Of course. It also takes time to ship the ore from my mine...<br /><br />Al: (shaking head) And what's up with the road surface? It looks like it's made of two-by fours.<br /><br />Doug: Yes, but that's just the default road surface that you get out-of-the-box. You can configure that arbitrarily at drive-time by injecting an appropriate implementation of the road-to-frame interface into the bridge configuration...<br /><br />Al: And the railings? Why aren't they done?<br /><br />Carl: There was insufficient evidence from the user-stories I collected over the last 5 months to support the effort required, so we de-scoped them.<br /><br />Al: (sigh) Is there anything else I should know?<br /><br />Eric: Well, I'm not too happy with the test coverage...<br /><br />Al: I have an idea for testing. You four get in a dumptruck and drive across. I'll wait here.</p></div></article></div></div><footer role="contentinfo"><p>Copyright © 2020 - Chris Perkins</p></footer></body></html>
