I emerged from this course without the slightest idea of how to use a computer in any way, much less how to write an actual program. I did, however, get a ninety-something percent in the course, based on my ability to write algorithms in Java with a pencil and paper during the final exam.<br />* HTML and VBScript, at ITI. Fortunately I had the good sense to eschew FrontPage, and wrote all my HTML in notepad, learning by looking at the source of other people's web pages.<br />* VB 6.  I'll say no more.<br />* Java again - this time with zero emphasis on algorithms (interestingly, I'm quite sure that the word "algorithm" was never once spoken by any of my teachers in my nine months at ITI), and lots of emphasis on getting an actual program that worked.<br />* SQL, in amongst the VB and Java.<br />* There was a course that used Oracle's PL/SQL language, which I managed to ignore as much as I could without failing the course.<br />* Around this time, I taught myself JavaScript and ColdFusion, intending to become a web developer, which I did.<br />* Two and a half years as a web developer. During this time I learned more JavaScript, more SQL, continually used ASP (VBScript) and ColdFusion, quite a lot of VB 6 (not by choice), occasionally Java, and of course got to know HTML inside and out.<br />* I also made a fairly concerted effort teach myself C++. This is a hard path to take without guidance, but I'm immensely glad that I did. When I left my web development gig and dropped myself headlong into a C++/Windows destop developer role, my extensive reading on C++ kept me from drowning - I found I had quite a bid of ingrained knowledge to fall back on when things just didn't seem to work right (which, with C++, is pretty much all the time).<br />* Finally, about four years ago, I somewhat randomly came across a language called Python. As there was a good tutorial on line, I started to learn it one day. That was my downfall.<br /><br />In the four years since learning Python, I have not felt the need to learn another language (except C++, by neccesity). I have stagnated. Python has always done what I want it to. Even now, I am still frequently amazed by how much easier it is to get something done in Python than it is in, say, C or Java or VB. I have isolated myself from the wider world of programming - when I need to get something done, I always turn to Python and look for the right add-on module or tool or technique to get it done - and I always seem to find it. But what am I missing out on?<br /><br />It would be absurd for me to believe that Python is the <span style="font-style: italic;">best</span> language there is. What evidence would I have to support that? The claims of people on the Python newsgroup? What do they know? Evey language has adherents who vehemently believe that it's the best there is. They can't all be right.<br /><br />So this past weekend, I finally took a step. I printed off most of Paul Graham's OnLisp, and started reading it over the weekend. I got through to chapter 10. I have a passing familiarity with Lisp - just enough that the code samples weren't completely over my head. This is not intended to be a book for learning Lisp, but a treatise on the use of Macros. Graham claims that macros, more than any other language feature, are what sets Lisp above all other languages in power. So, the intent being to expand my mind to possibilities that lie outiside the realm of the languages I know, I decided to learn Lisp this way.<br /><br />I was a bit weird trying to learn Lisp while loungin around at the cottage, where there is no computer. I wan't able to try out any of the examples myself - I had to just read them and try to understand what they were doing. This turned out to be not too hard to do.<br /><br />So what's my impression of Lisp so far (up to chapter 10?). It's not nearly as compelling (yet) as Graham tries to make it sound. He is continually talking about much better Lisp is than "other languages", but in only one spot did I see any other languages mentioned by name, and these were C, Pascal, and Fortran. Clearly, to someone coming from that sort of background, Lisp would be a radical paradigm shift - but to someone coming from a language like Python, there not (yet) much that's new. There are a few Lisp features that make me say "hey, that would be handy in Python", and just as many that make me say "man, that code looks awkward - it would be way cleaner in Python". But to be fair, the main thrust of the book - the illustration of the power of macros - is still ahead. I haven't read far enough to have an appreciation for whether macros really are something new and magical to me, or if they are just a curiosity. So far, the cynical part of my is saying "all macros do is move some of the complexity from run time to compile time - if a program runs fast enough anyway, so what?". But I'm keeping an open mind, and I'll read on in the weeks ahead.<br /><br />Lisp is just one step. I think sometimes that I should play a bit of catch-up, and learn a few more languages now. Ruby is on my list - I decided to go with Lisp first, because I thought it would have more radical differences from Python, and thus be more mind-expanding. While Ruby has some neat stuff, I suspect it has less to offer that Python doesn't have already. I am eager to try out continuations, however, and either Ruby or Scheme would suffice for that. I wonder what other languages directly support continuations. Stackless Python?<br /><br />And, once I get going on learning new stuff, I always get carried away planning all the other new stuff I want to learn. It's really out of control. I think I have more fun planning what I'm going to learn than I do actually learning it. My mental list of languages and tools to learn is ever-changing, and probably includes about 50 items - I just can't remember most of them at any given time.</p></div></article></div></div><footer role="contentinfo"><p>Copyright Â© 2020 - Chris Perkins</p></footer></body></html>
