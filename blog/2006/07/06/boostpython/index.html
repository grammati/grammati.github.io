It was a disappointing experience, but I can't say that I'm surprised.  I always had the impression that boost::python would be one of those tools that works great and seems to be really powerful as long as you are doing something that is very nearly exactly what the tutorial is doing.  As soon as you try to diverge from that you run into problems.  Problems like:<br /></p><ul><li>Understanding error messages is impossible, because the code is alien-voodoo template magic that humans can never understand.</li><li>Building is a nightmare, because you pretty much have to use bjam, which is just like boost::python itself in that you have to follow the examples from the docs, or you're sunk.  Trying to find out how to do anything else is a lost cause.</li></ul>My nightmare for the last two hours has been trying to get bjam to link to a .lib file.  Sounds easy, right?  Well it's not.  Googling for a solution has only led me to believe that:<br /><ul><li>No one else in the world is using boost on Windows.  They're all Linux weenies.</li><li>Everyone who writes about boost assumes that everyone else in the world already knows how to do this, so they don't bother to explain it.</li><li>No one in the world has ever used boost::python to write a wrapper for a DLL.  If they had, they would have had exactly the problem that I'm having, they would have written to the C++-sig list for an answer, and I would have found that answer on google.</li></ul>OK, I feel very slightly better.  Now I can go home.</div></article></div></div><footer role="contentinfo"><p>Copyright Â© 2020 - Chris Perkins</p></footer></body></html>
