I'm not entirely sure how to resolve this, but one solution that comes to mind is just to break up the sessions across multiple days. <br /> <br />For example, let's say I'm at the point where I have 6 problems in my ciruit.  The conventional wisdom (or at least, the way I've always done it) would be to do a full session (18+ ascents) about twice a week - say wednesdays and saturdays.  That way I get totally blasted and sore, feel like I've trained super-hard (which I have), and then rest for 3 full days. <br /> <br />Instead, I could do a smaller session, using problems 1,3, and 5 one day, do the same again with problems 2,4, and 6 the next day, and then rest only one day. <br /> <br />This way I could train power 2 days on, one or 2 days off, or 4 times per week.  The total volume per week is the same, but it's just more spread out.  Is this better?  I'm not sure, but I think it might be.  Some of the reading I have done (I can't cite any source right now) suggests that when power training, you should not get pumped.  By doing the full 6-problem session in one day instead of over two days, I think I would only succeed in forcing myself to do the second half of the session while pumped or tired.  The most power gains come from pulling as hard as you can while NOT tired. <br /> <br />So I think this may be the way to go, especially since I'm going to finally have a home wall to train on this year.  My only concern is whether I will be able to recover enough to do power two days in a row, even if the sessions are short.  I guess I'll find out. <br /> <br /> <br /></p></div></article></div></div><footer role="contentinfo"><p>Copyright Â© 2020 - Chris Perkins</p></footer></body></html>
