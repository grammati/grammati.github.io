I know, I say that every year - but this year we are going to finally have a good woody at home. Also, I'm turing 35, so if I'm ever going to climb realy really hard, I had better do it soon, before my body deteriorates into a pile of jello. <br /> <br />I have known for years that I have plateaued because I don't do smart training. Every winter I get strong within the first month or so of starting to go the the gym regularly, but I always reach the same level and then stay there - I can always do about V8 consistently, but I never get past about V10 no matter how much I boulder. I need to break out of my pattern and train a different way this year. <br /> <br />Key Elements: <br />1) Weight Training. <br />2) High fequency, lower volume power training <br />3) Weighted climing <br /> <br />Training Techniques: <br /> <br />My favorite technique is this: develop a circuit of boulder problems - 3 or4 to start with, of varying styles and with some variation in difficulty (but none too easy). After warming up, start with the hardest of these problems, and climb it 3 times in a maximum of 6 attempts. When you have done either 3 successful sends, or 6 attempts, move on the the next-hardest problem. Always rest at least 2 or 3 minutes between attempts (more if you need it). Once you can do 3 sends of each problem, it's time to add another, harder problem to the circuit. Work out the moves, and on your next session this will become the first problem in your circuit. If you can just barely manage to send the problem once in 6 attempts on the fist day that you add it to your circuit, then it is just about the right level of difficulty. After a few weeks, you will be sending it 3 times in a row, and will start working on an even harder problem. <br /> <br />One nice thing about this system is that after a few months your initial few problems, which were hard for you when you started, are now the "easy" problems that you do at the end of the session, when you are tired, and you still manage to send them 3-in-a-row every time. By this time you have done these problems a hundred times, and have become so efficient at them that you don't have to think at all - you are purely focused on being strong enough to hold on. <br /> <br />I am thinking about trying a variation on this system where, instead of adding a new problem to the circuit every time I'm ready to advance, I add weight instead. For example, say I start with a circuit of 4 problems. As soon as I send them 3 times each in a session, I advance the difficulty by adding 5 pounds to a wieght vest. From this point on, for the rest of my training cycle (~4 months or so), I never do a session without the weight vest on - yes, that's right, NEVER. <br /> <br />Now I alternate between adding problems and adding weight to up the difficulty. So once I send my 4 problems with the 5 pounds on, I add a problem to the start of the circuit. Once I can send the 5 problems (remember, sending always means 3 times in 6 or fewer attempts) with the 5 pounds on, I go up to, say, 8 or 10 pounds. And so on... <br /> <br />I figure on upping the difficulty every week or 2 - let's say 3 times per month. Over a 4 month power-training cycle, let's say 10 times, roughly. That's 5 times adding 5 pounds to the vest, and 5 new, increasingly hard problems added to the circuit. <br /> <br />So at the end of the cycle (if I'm not in the intesive care ward), a session will consist of climbing 9 hard problems 3+ times each - that's a minimum of 27 ascents, or roughly 27 * (5 to 8 moves) ~ 180 moves, all with 25 pounds on the weight vest. Ouch. <br /> <br />Now comes the fun part - 4 or 5 days after that last, monster session, imagine walking into a comp, or up to the Mushroom Boulder on day one of a late-winter road trip, and pulling down with NO weight-vest on for the first time in almost 4 months - can you imaging how strong you would feel?  Do you know what it feels like to lose 25 pounds overnight?  I don't, yet, but I certainly curious to find out. <br /> <br /></p></div></article></div></div><footer role="contentinfo"><p>Copyright Â© 2020 - Chris Perkins</p></footer></body></html>
