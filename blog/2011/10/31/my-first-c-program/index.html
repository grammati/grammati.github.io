I don't remember which compiler I was using - this was on Windows. The program just did this:<br /><br /></p><ul><li>Read an integer command-line argument - the array size</li><li>Allocate an int-array of the given size</li><li>Fill the array with random integers</li><li>Sort the array, in-place</li><li>Loop through the array to check that is really is sorted</li><li>Print out "OK", or something like that.</li></ul><div>After a few minor hiccups, I was delighted when the program compiled, and my first run, with a short array (100 elements, maybe - I don't remember), sorted correctly.</div><div><br /></div><div>But I was suspicious - "OK" was being printed, but was it <i>really</i> working? I examined the code carefully, and managed to convince myself that it could not possibly print OK unless the array really was sorted. So I started trying larger inputs.</div><div><br /></div><div>1000. No problem. Running my program from the command-line, there was no perceptible delay between hitting Return, and "OK" being printed out.</div><div><br /></div><div>10000. Same thing.</div><div><br /></div><div>100K. Then a million. Then I <i>know</i> something is very wrong. The program is simply printing out "OK" immediately. There should be a pause while it works, before the result is printed. It cannot possibly be sorting a million integers more-or-less instantly.</div><div><br /></div><div>I examine the code again, with a fine-tooth comb, looking for any possible way that it could be just jumping to the end. But the code is simple and clear - I can't see any way that it could possibly not be working. This is getting frustrating.</div><div><br /></div><div>Finally I decide to crank it up one more notch, just to be really, really sure. Ten million integers. I type in the command and press return. Again, it prints "OK" - but this time there is an ever-so- brief delay.</div><div><br /></div><div>And in that moment - in that brief, sub-second moment before "OK" appears on my screen - everything changes. In that tiny pause, I am bowled over by the realization of just how fast - how astoundingly, mind-bendingly fast - modern computers are. I really can sort a million integers faster than I can blink.</div><div><br /></div><div>A whole world of possibilities opened up for me in that instant. Until that moment I had been wrapped in the safe warm layers of interpreters and runtimes and frameworks. Because of that, I had never really had a feel for just how fast the hardware underneath could be. It took the bare-metal power of C to reveal that to me.</div><div><br /></div></div></article></div></div><footer role="contentinfo"><p>Copyright © 2020 - Chris Perkins</p></footer></body></html>
