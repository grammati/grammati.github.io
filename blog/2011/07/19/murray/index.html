It's a morning like any other - coffee, toast, getting ready for the day. Murray stretches sleepily on the couch and lifts his head to look at me. I rub his head and tell him he's a good boy. Just another morning, like any other. Just another day. Right, Murray? Just another day. I step out onto the back deck with my coffee and try to hold back tears.<br /><br />Time passes too quickly. Eight o-clock is coming too fast. I eat, shower, the babysitter arrives, and it's time to walk out the door. We tell the kids to come over and give Murray a hug. But they're too young to understand why. Thankfully, too young to understand why.<br /><br />It's a walk like any other morning, like every other morning - sniff, pee, sniff some more. No hurry. Nothing out of the ordinary. Just another day, right Murray? Just another day. As Murray explores in the long grass, Tracy drives past us in the car, watching. I see can my thoughts reflected in her face.<br /><br />"Come on, Murray", I say, as he lags behind, chewing on some blades of grass. It's 7:56. We don't have much time. But it doesn't feel right, telling him to hurry - he has no idea what he's hurrying towards.<br /><br />Today, we walk just a little bit further than usual. Past the gas station, around the corner to the strip mall. This is different. This isn't where we normally go for our walks.<br /><br />We see someone standing on the sidewalk. As Murray gets closer, he realizes that it's Tracy, and he drags me the last few steps to greet her. What an exciting surprise - Mom's here. She's still holding it together. Not me - with each step closer to the door, I'm falling apart.<br /><br />We compose ourselves for a minute and then go inside. The employees smile and greet Murray by name. They all know why we're here. We go straight into "the room". I had no idea they would have a special room for this. It's all set up with a comfy dog-bed and a jar of liver-treats for Murray, and a box of Kleenex for us.<br /><br />Everything starts to go too fast. They take him to put the catheter in his leg, where the needle will go in, and then he's back. We're stuffing him with liver-treats, and he's so excited. He never gets liver because it gives him the runs. Doesn't matter now.<br /><br />The vet comes back in holding a needle. Seeing it, full of bright green liquid, suddenly makes all this just a little bit more real to me. It's really happening. No-one is going to say "Oops, our mistake, turns out it's not cancer at all. Here are some pills that will make him all better."  No-one is going to say "He's not that bad yet - come back in a few weeks."<br /><br />Part of me wants to say "Wait - he's still happy - it's not time yet." But I know that's not true. I know it's time. I can see into his mouth, and one of the treats is stuck in there, unable to get past the baseball-sized tumor that has almost closed his throat, leaving little more than a slit for him to breathe through.<br /><br />We calm him down and sit on the floor on either side of him, talking to him and stroking his head as the needle goes in. It only takes seconds. His head droops in my arms, and I lay him down gently on the floor. That's it. It's over. We stay for ten minutes or so, feeling the softness of his fur for the last time, looking at his peaceful face, trying to take a mental snapshot that will last a lifetime. Then we walk out and go home.<br /><br />Back in the house, the chaos of everyday life takes over. The kids are running around screaming, as usual. There are dishes to be done. It's a workday. After a little while, I sit down at the computer and try to get some work done. Tracy takes the kids out in the backyard to play. It's just another day - a day like any other, right Murray? Just another day.<br /><br />But after today, none of our days will ever be the same again.<br /><br /></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Nk-T4V4eH9g/SOqVH6afC3I/AAAAAAAAAFM/PYxAR13DQPE/s1600/DSC03699.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Nk-T4V4eH9g/SOqVH6afC3I/AAAAAAAAAFM/PYxAR13DQPE/s320/DSC03699.JPG" width="214" /></a></div><br /></div></article></div></div><footer role="contentinfo"><p>Copyright © 2020 - Chris Perkins</p></footer></body></html>
