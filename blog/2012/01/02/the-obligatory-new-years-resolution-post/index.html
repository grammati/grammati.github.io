I could spend that time <i>doing</i> stuff instead of reading about it.</div><div><br /></div><div>Get less sleep: Life is short. I want to have time to do stuff, and sleep-time is pretty much the only part of my life that I am willing and able to give up. 6 hours is plenty, right?</div><div><br /></div><div>Drink more coffee: Coffee is a natural and healthy alternative to sleep. Seriously, ask any scientist.</div><div><br /></div><div>Drink more alcohol: There are just too many yummy varieties of whiskey to try, and so little time to try them all.</div><div><br /></div><div>Be more of an asshole: I'm actually very nice to people. Nice people never get anywhere in life. The rest of the world needs to be made aware than, in general, I am right and they are wrong and they should be ashamed of that.</div><div><br /></div><div>Be less organized: I put too much effort into writing down and sorting and categorizing things that I intend to do, but never actually do. Stop it.</div><div><br /></div><div>Put less effort into important work: My employer will continue to profit, regardless of the amount of effort I put in. I can afford to slack off a bit.</div><div><br /></div><div>Put more effort into trivial, unimportant work: Looking back, I always get the most satisfaction out of things that started as off-the-cuff, just-for-fun side projects. Do more of those.</div><div><br /></div><br class="Apple-interchange-newline" /></div></article></div></div><footer role="contentinfo"><p>Copyright © 2020 - Chris Perkins</p></footer></body></html>
