I have for years. The tools have gotten vastly better over the years I have been doing Clojure, but we can still do much better.</p><p>Having just seen several great talks about tools at Clojure Conj, I'm convinced that we can do better right now. In particular:</p><ul><li>Proto-REPL - Jason showed off exactly the kind of data-structure visualizations that I have been dreaming of for years. I sure do love me some emacs, but I could be convinced to change if this thing is good enough.</li><li>Sayid - Bill gave a glimpse into the future with a tool that captures a complete record of a program's execution, fully inspectable. This, too, I have been dreaming of for years. (I even started to write almost exactly the same thing myself, <a href="https://github.com/grammati/rosco">here</a>, but didn't get nearly as far with it as Bill has).</li></ul><p>In addition, there were a <em>lot</em> of talks about clojure.spec, and I'm embarrassed to admit that I haven't really tried it yet, but I have high hopes.</p><p>Finally, spectrum looks extremely promising - it's more-or-less a static type checker for Clojure.</p><p>In addition to all that, I'm becoming convinced that I need to make more effort to build visibility into my programs. I do plenty of logging, but poring through logs sucks. I'm not entirely sure how to go about this, but in general I'm thinking about putting in more "dev-mode only" code that captures data in various places (eg: messages received on a kafka queue) and exposes them through special, dev-mode only HTTP endpoints. I'll need to explore this to get a more concrete idea of what would be useful.</p></div></article></div></div><footer role="contentinfo"><a href="/atom.xml">Feed</a><p>Copyright Â© 2020 - Chris Perkins</p></footer></body></html>
