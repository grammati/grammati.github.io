                      In 2012 I joined Rally Software, continuing through the 2015 acquisition by CA Technologies. I
                      have worked primarily in Clojure, building JVM-based microservices to replace pieces of a monolithic
                      Java system. I developed Rally's authentication service, including an Oauth 2 server, SSO
                      integration, and associated APIs and user interfaces. I also developed Rally's next-generation
                      realtime system, which processes change-messages generated from events in our SAAS system, and uses
                      them to power email notifications, webhooks, and realtime UI updates over websockets. All services
                      were built using continuous deployment and test-driven development, with a heavy focus on realtime
                      monitoring and high availability.

					          <h3>Software Developer</h3>
					          <h4>2005-present</h4>
                    <p>
                      At IBM I work on the Cognos Mobile team, developing tools to enable access to
                      Cognos's reporting and analytics through mobile devices. We currently have a
                      web client and native iPad client, with an Android client in development.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Prior to that I worked on the team that created Adaptive Analytics, which is
                      an IDE-like tool for producing "Analytic Applications" - targeted suites of
                      reports that run against a data warehouse. I was a key player on the team
                      through two generations of the product - the first a pure-C++ application, and
                      the second a more advanced version using a browser-based UI with a C++
                      server-side component.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      The first generation of Adaptive Analytics is a C++ application that uses MFC
                      for the UI, and has an "engine" component that is cross-platorm. I started as
                      one of the first members of the team, at a time when the application was no
                      more than a sketch on a whiteboard. We worked in rapid iterations to get the
                      application from blank page to shippable in less than a year, working out
                      requirements and collaborating to come up with solutions as required.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        Participated actively in the full lifecycle of the product, from
                        whiteboard to release.</li>
                      <li>
                        Implemented the core of the report-generation process, designing and
                        implementing the algorithms for transforming the application model into XML
                        via a combination of C++ and XSLT.</li>
                      <li>
                        Collaborated closely with teammates and product management to negotiate
                        priorities, working rapidly to implement and refine features (essentially
                        doing Agile before we had heard of the term).</li>
                      <li>
                        Continued to contribute to the development through 3 major releases of the
                        product, while simultaneously beginning work on its next generation.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                      The second generation of the Adaptive Analytics moved the UI the web, and
                      introduced a much more interactive user experience. The first generation
                      provided an IDE-like environment from which a report designer could quicky and
                      easily batch-generate reports, but the consumer of those reports still had a
                      fairly static view of his data. With the second-gereration, report-generation is
                      done on-the-fly, allowing the end-user to extensively modify both the data and
                      the presentation of the reports.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The application logic is largely in JavaScript, which communicates with the
                      server through a strictly RESTful API, passing back and forth
                      XML-representations of model objects. All HTML generation is done on the
                      client-side, using Dojo widgets extensively. Code-generation produces both
                      JavaScript and C++ reprentations of the application's object-model, ensuring
                      that they are in sync. The client side comprises a complete MVC framework in
                      which model objects can be read from XML, manipulated by the controller and UI
                      components, and written back to XML. Events, including property-change events
                      for model objects, are used extensively to enforce loose coupling of widgets
                      in the UI.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>

					          <h3>Software Engineer</h3>
					          <h4>2002-2005</h4>
					          <p>
                      I worked for 3 years at PixeLINK, a small, Ottawa-based manufacturer of
                      streaming digital video cameras, targeting the medical and
                      industrial-inspection markets.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Designed and wrote an application to show off the features of the PixeLINK
                      API for capturing video and images, controlling the camera (frame-rate,
                      exposure, etc.), processing image data, applying image correction.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Wrote an application for programming and calibrating newly manufactured
                      cameras. Built an ever-growing suite of calibration routines to detect and
                      correct various kinds of systemic imperfections in the sensors.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Wrote various in-house tools for working with PixeLINK cameras. Wrote a Python
                      extension module wrapping the PixeLINK API, allowing me to write many of our
                      in-house tools in Python. Used wxPython for UI, Numpy and Scipy for image
                      processing.

                      At inBusiness Systems I did several web development
                      projects as part of federal government contracts.

                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        A comprehensive contact-management application, modeled after "Contacts" in
                        Outlook, developed in Cold Fusion, for the Transportation Safety Board of
                        Canada. The application required a pure-HTML interface that looked as
                        similar as possible the interface in Outlook, but allowed fine-grained
                        access controls at the field-level, per-record. I designed and created the
                        database (Oracle) and wrote all of the code.

                        An ASP web application (old-school, pre-.NET ASP) for the Privy Council
                        Office, to replace an old green-screen COBOL program for managing Orders in
                        Council. The application is used to manage the workflow for maintaining and
                        archiving these documents. Team size: 4.

                      <li>
                        An ASP web application for placing PowerPoint presentations on the intranet
                        at Transport Canada, by uploading the file and having it converted to HTML
                        format on the server.

                      <li>
                        A project to clean up many thousands of internal web
                          pages for DND to use more standardized HTML. Used
                          Python to automate FrontPage via its COM interface,
                          allowing me to process thousands of documents per
