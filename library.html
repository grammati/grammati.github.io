For a book that&#x27;s considered such a classic, it was kind-of meh for me, story-wise.</p><p>More interesting was that the book highlighted how hard predictions are (especially about the future). Asimov was writing about a time thousands of years away, but some of the technology described seems quaintly anachronistic, even by today&#x27;s standards, mere decades after writing. For example, a character gets off a spaceship and gets into a taxi driven (or flown) by a human driver. Another asks for a &quot;copy&quot; of a book. And the overarching concept, that a man can can predict the future through the science of psychology is laughable now - these days psychology is barely considered a science at all.</p></div></div></div></div><div data-state="inactive" data-orientation="vertical" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="radix-:R9m:-trigger-2022" hidden="" id="radix-:R9m:-content-2022" tabindex="0"></div><div data-state="inactive" data-orientation="vertical" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="radix-:R9m:-trigger-2021" hidden="" id="radix-:R9m:-content-2021" tabindex="0"></div><div data-state="inactive" data-orientation="vertical" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="radix-:R9m:-trigger-2020" hidden="" id="radix-:R9m:-content-2020" tabindex="0"></div></div></div><footer class="footer"><p>© Chris Perkins 2023</p></footer></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"books":[{"title":"The Liars' Club","author":"Mary Karr","asin":"B008LY24II","status":"in-progress","year":"2023","href":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008LY24II/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8\u0026camp=1789\u0026creative=9325\u0026creativeASIN=B008LY24II\u0026linkCode=as2","image":"//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8\u0026ASIN=B008LY24II\u0026Format=_SL160_\u0026ID=AsinImage\u0026MarketPlace=US\u0026ServiceVersion=20070822\u0026WS=1\u0026language=en_US"},{"title":"Pieces of the Action","author":"Vannevar Bush","asin":"B0B15CCH7N","status":"in-progress","year":"2023","href":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0B15CCH7N/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8\u0026camp=1789\u0026creative=9325\u0026creativeASIN=B0B15CCH7N\u0026linkCode=as2","image":"//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8\u0026ASIN=B0B15CCH7N\u0026Format=_SL160_\u0026ID=AsinImage\u0026MarketPlace=US\u0026ServiceVersion=20070822\u0026WS=1\u0026language=en_US"},{"title":"The Man from the Future","author":"Ananyo Bhattacharya","asin":"B098TYZN67","month":"Apr","year":"2023","href":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B098TYZN67/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8\u0026camp=1789\u0026creative=9325\u0026creativeASIN=B098TYZN67\u0026linkCode=as2","image":"//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8\u0026ASIN=B098TYZN67\u0026Format=_SL160_\u0026ID=AsinImage\u0026MarketPlace=US\u0026ServiceVersion=20070822\u0026WS=1\u0026language=en_US"},{"title":"The Song of the Cell","author":"Siddhartha Mukherjee","asin":"B09RX45W14","month":"Apr","year":"2023","href":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09RX45W14/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8\u0026camp=1789\u0026creative=9325\u0026creativeASIN=B09RX45W14\u0026linkCode=as2","image":"//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8\u0026ASIN=B09RX45W14\u0026Format=_SL160_\u0026ID=AsinImage\u0026MarketPlace=US\u0026ServiceVersion=20070822\u0026WS=1\u0026language=en_US"},{"title":"Luminous","author":"Greg Egan","asin":"B00E84BABW","month":"Mar","year":"2023","href":"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00E84BABW/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8\u0026camp=1789\u0026creative=9325\u0026creativeASIN=B00E84BABW\u0026linkCode=as2","image":"//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8\u0026ASIN=B00E84BABW\u0026Format=_SL160_\u0026ID=AsinImage\u0026MarketPlace=US\u0026ServiceVersion=20070822\u0026WS=1\u0026language=en_US"},{"title":"Stone Mattress","author":"Margaret Atwood","asin":"B00J6YBOBK","month":"Feb","notes":["Keeping this reading log, I'm realizing that I have been reading a lot of short story collections recently.
