Asimov was writing about a time thousands of years away, but some of the technology described seems quaintly anachronistic, even by today's standards, mere decades after writing. For example, a character gets off a spaceship and gets into a taxi driven (or flown) by a human driver. Another asks for a \"copy\" of a book.
